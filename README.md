# cpp_playground
A playground for (silly) C++ hacks and various experiments - This c++ code has gone dirty.

Most of the files are tiny experiments or code snippets I used for demos and illustrations.

# building 

Use cmake for building. Since the CMakeList.txt relies on globbing for finding files it needs to be run for every file. 


```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
```
